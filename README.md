## Credits
Thanks to [Kris Jenkins](https://github.com/krisajenkins) for his Helm Spotify package which heavily inspired this project. I'd also like to thank Kris for his excellent [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjKtkEMUYGc&feature=youtu.be) which introduced me to the world of Emacs Lisp.
